# Decentralized To-Do Application with AI Agent Integration

## Project Overview
This project is a **decentralized to-do application (dApp)** that integrates **blockchain technology**, a **responsive user interface**, and an **AI agent** for task management and prioritization. The application allows users to securely manage their tasks on a decentralized platform while leveraging AI for intelligent task prioritization, reminders, and productivity tips.

## Features
1. **Frontend**:
   - Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
   - Display task completion analytics (e.g., percentage of tasks completed).
   - Responsive and user-friendly interface built with **React.js**.

2. **Backend**:
   - RESTful APIs for task management (CRUD operations).
   - User authentication using **JWT**.
   - Integration with blockchain for task verification.

3. **Blockchain**:
   - Smart contract to store and verify task hashes on the blockchain.
   - Deployed on a testnet (e.g., **Goerli** or **Polygon**).

4. **AI Agent**:
   - Task prioritization based on deadlines and task types.
   - Reminders for overdue tasks.
   - Optional: Motivational or productivity tips.
